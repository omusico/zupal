#summary the internal marketplace for Zupal modules

= Introduction =

You shouldn't have to go to a web page to download a Zupal module, FTP it to your site, review it or submit a bug: all those functions should be an internal feature of every Zupal project. The Zupal Module Marketplace (Zoom) should be completely transparent, like the App store on an iPhone.

You should be able to read on a module version's description, click on an install link, and get the upgrade. Similarly, every time a module throws an error, a message goes back to Zoom and is up for grabs for a patch or at least, a comment. 

So if one of your user gets a trappable error, the admin should get a mail and perhaps a series of mails as Zupal module developers note, comment on, and patch the problem. You could even turn on "auto fix" for a module to allow for authorized fixes from module owners to be automatically included to your site.

= Details =

Zupal Zoom should include:

  * Bug Tracking
  * User Commentary
  * Versioning 
  * Reviews and rating
  * Usage Stats (opitonal for installers)
  
= Security =

There is a fair amount of room for security holes in something like this. Leaving a manual step -- such as forcing the user to untar/zip a patch -- would take some pressure off us for security in rev 1 (of Zoom).
