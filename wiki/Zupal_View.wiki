#summary The Visual resources for this page

= Introduction =

At this stage most of the visual systems of Zupal are simply utilization of the existing Zend resources. here are a few exceptions

== The Menu System ==

The current menu system is fairly brutal; there is a single navigation menu that lists all the current modules and a submenu (optional) that is defined by a menu config file in the menu root that appears whenever a module's action is called. Further development will tie menus to the ACL system as it develops. 

If you want to customize the submenu for context/ACL, you can access the submenu of the global navigation (accessible through the nav placeholder) and change the submenu property of the current modules' menu item. 

== Customizing the Layout for Context. ==

There are two stock elements in the view placeholder context: breadcrumb and page_title. 
Each view should set the page title and optionally append items to the breadcrumb. (the breadcrumb is currently satisfied with another use of the Zupal_Menu class at present.) 

Here is an example of customizing the placeholders in a view script:

{{{
	$this->placeholder('page_title')->set($this->content->title());
	$breadcrumb = $this->placeholder('breadcrumb');
	$breadcrumb = $breadcrumb[0];
	$breadcrumb->set_item($this->content->title()); 
        // note -- this is a static text item in the breadcrumb 
        /// and will not be clickable. 
	$this->placeholder('breadcrumb')->set($breadcrumb);
}}}


== Layouts == 

The current system is locked into a single default layout; a templating system is to come.
