	<h1>Developing in Zupal</h1>
	<p>Because Zupal is a very new project, getting started with Zuupal requires a little manual jiggery.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Check out Zupal from svn. (If you are reading this you have done this already.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a database named zupal in SVN. (Zupal currenrtly only supports mySQL but this should change soon.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Run the sql script in this folder within that database. (its pretty small at this point -- should be fine in phpMyAdmin.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a database user / password for the databases as defined for development under application/config/configuration.xml
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note -- there are several options for configuration 
	(which at this point governs not much more than your domain, database access.)
	Environmental variables are part of the CGI system -- see http://hoohoo.ncsa.illinois.edu/cgi/env.html for details.
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>You can create your own node and hook into it by changing the environmental designation in .htaccess; this requires you to lock those files
	from SVN subission though. </li>
	<li>You can clone set_env_template.php as set_env.php and change the environment there. You will still need to add a node to configuration.xml
	though, and take care not to check it in.</li>
	<li>You can "suck it up" and configure your database and localhost as defined in the stock
	development definition in configuration.xml.</li>
	</ol>
  </body>
